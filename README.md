ATTILA GPU Simulator
===============

Introduction
-------------

ATTILA is GPU simulator with OpenGL and D3D9 API implementations that can be used
to simulate PC Windows game traces.

In the ATTILA source code included in this package you will find the classes used
to build the simulator, the API implementations to run OpenGL and D3D9 game traces
on this simulator, the API trace tools and a number of tools that had been used on
the development of this project.

Some of the techniques and algorithms implemented in the simulator may be covered
by patents (for example DXTC/S3TC compression or the Z compression algorithm).

No documentation about the source code, the simulator or the library is provided within
this package.  Check for documentation available documentation in the ATTILA wiki:

How to compile on GNU/Linux
----------------------------

    Usage: make [clean | simclean]
           make [what options]
    
    clean      - Delete all OBJs and binary files.
    simclean   - Delete only simulator related OBJs, and binary files.
    
    what:
           all                  - Build ATTILA simulator and tools
           bGPU                 - Build ATTILA simulator and emulator
           gl2atila             - Build gl2atila
           extractTraceRegion   - Build extractTraceRegion
    
    options:
    
            CONFIG={ debug  | profiling | optimized | verbose }
                debug     - Compile with debug information
                profiling - Compile with profiling information
                optimized - Maximum optimization (default)
    
            CPU=<cpu>
                <cpu>   - Target cpu for compilation. This lets apply some optimizations.
                          Possible values: x86, x86_64, pentium4, athlon, core2
    
            VERBOSE={ yes | no }
                yes     - Activate debug messages
                no      - Deactive debug messages (default)
    
            PLATFORM=<platf>
                <platf> - Target platform for compilation.
                          Possible values: linux (default), cygwin
